"""Baby Names exercise

Define the extract_names() function below and change main()
to call it.


Here's what the html looks like in the baby.html files:
...
<h3 align="center">Popularity in 1990</h3>
....
<tr align="right"><td>1</td><td>Michael</td><td>Jessica</td>
<tr align="right"><td>2</td><td>Christopher</td><td>Ashley</td>
<tr align="right"><td>3</td><td>Matthew</td><td>Brittany</td>
...

Suggested milestones for incremental development:
 -Extract the year and print it
 -Extract the names and rank numbers and just print them
 -Get the names data into a dict and print it
 -Build the [year, 'name rank', ... ] list and print it
 -Fix main() to use the extract_names list
