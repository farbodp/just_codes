 Given strings a and b, return a single string with a and b separated
 by a space '<a> <b>', except swap the first 2 chars of each string.
 e.g.

   'dog', 'dinner' -> 'dig donner'

Given a string, if its length is at least 3,

add 'ly' instead.
If the string length is less than 3, leave it unchanged.
Return the resulting string.'''

 Given an int count of a number of donuts, return a string

 instead of the actual count.

 Consider dividing a string into two halves.
 If the length is even, the front and back halves are the same length.
 If the length is odd, we'll say that the extra char goes in the front half.

 Given a string s, return a string

 been changed to '*', except do not change
 the first char itself.
 e.g. 'babble' yields 'ba**le'
 Assume that the string is length 1 or more.
